    I'm from the far east. You can say it's the Orient. Before coding I was working a bunch of odd jobs that I really did not care about. Why Coding? Because why the fuck not? That's why.

<h3>Programming Languages</h3>

    HTML, CSS, Javascript, REACT.js, Node.js, Angular.js, Ruby, Python, and some mo.
